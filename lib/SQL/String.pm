=head1 NAME

SQL::String - An object representation of a chunk of SQL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  <iAlias> I hate SQL::
  <iAlias> Guess what SQL::Snippit is
  <brevity> a not very useful library. I've looked at that.
  <iAlias> "A snippit of SQL"? NO! A giant complex library and storage and frameworks and junk
  <iAlias> That's all I want
  <iAlias> Every decent name I could take for a simple little tied-param chunk of SQL is taken by a "giant framework"
  <brevity> Alias: the reason is because SQL does not lend itself to small helpful modules
  <iAlias> It's like CGI all over again :)
  <rhizo> hehe
  <brevity> alias: dunno if you want to make your own big framework
  <iAlias> I have my own big framework :)
  <xantus_> heh
  <iAlias> I just want some nice little toys to clean it up a bit
  <iAlias> aha! Nobody has taken SQL::String yet
  <iAlias> It's mine I tellses you! My own... my precious...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module does not exist yet, but I'm taking the name dammit! It's mine! Sod off!!
